### Computer System Components

#### System Bus

a communication pathway that connects the major components of a computer, including the CPU,
memory, and I/O devices. It is comprised of three parts:

- Data Bus: Transfers data between the different components.
- Address Bus: Carries the memory addresses that specify where data should be sent or retrieved from.
- Control Bus: Transmits control and timing signals to synchronize operations.

#### Processor

#### Main Memory

Aka real memory or primary memory. (RAM)
it's volatile. Contents of the memory is lost when the computer is shut down.

##### registers

temp memory which the cpu can use for instruction operands.

##### cache

memoy close to cpu that mirrors values from RAM

##### RAM

##### ROM

#### I/O Modules

Why do we need I/O buffer? to save CPU workload
